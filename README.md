Lambdata is a `<package>` that allows `<data scientist>` to do `<some panda functions faster >`.

Lambdata use pandas and sklearn libraries to speed up your data wrangling speed. \
Instead of having to write a long code or using different libraries, you can achieve what you want to do in 1 line of code \
For example, you can find the number of Null value in DataFrame with null_count() functions \
Or split an address into three different columns in DataFrame with addy_split()
